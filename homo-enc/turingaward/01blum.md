In the 60s he developed an axiomatic complexity theory which was independent of concrete machine models. The theory is based on Gödel numberings(哥德尔的定理是如何玩坏数学的！http://www.sohu.com/a/240475763_107944 ‘为了把语句编码为唯一的数，我们让它的哥德尔数等于一部分素数的幂的乘积，幂的次数为数学符号在列表中的位置。因此，0=0的哥德尔数是2^1 · 3^2 · 5^1 = 90’, https://en.wikipedia-mirror.org/wiki/Church_encoding lambda calculas ) and the Blum axioms. Even though the theory is not based on any machine model it yields concrete results like the compression theorem, the gap theorem, the honesty theorem and the Blum speedup theorem.

Some of his other work includes a protocol for flipping a coin over a telephone, median of medians (a linear time selection algorithm), the Blum Blum Shub pseudorandom number generator, the Blum-Goldwasser cryptosystem, and more recently CAPTCHAs.
